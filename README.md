# üõ°Ô∏èDisasterReady PWA 
DisasterReady is a comprehensive, offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to integrate structured disaster management education directly into the school curriculum. This project was developed for the Smart India Hackathon to address the critical gap in disaster preparedness in Indian schools.

## ‚ú® Key Features
This isn't just a website; it's a feature-rich, resilient application built for real-world emergency scenarios.

**Offline-First Architecture:** The entire learning experience, including all videos and illustrative images, is precached. The app is 100% functional without an internet connection after the first install, which is critical for use during a disaster when connectivity is down.

**Installable PWA:** Users can install DisasterReady to their home screen on any device (mobile or desktop) for an instant, native-app-like experience.

**Real-Time, Multi-Disaster SOS System:** A dedicated, offline-capable emergency.html page provides one-click buttons to call specific emergency services (Police, Fire, Ambulance) and send a pre-written SMS with the user's exact GPS location to emergency contacts.

**Gamified Learning Modules:** The core of the app is a series of 7 disaster-specific chapters. The learning experience is enhanced with:

**Virtual Drills:** Short, halal-compliant animated videos for each chapter.

**Illustrative Images:** High-quality images to supplement text and improve comprehension.

**Quizzes:** A 10-question quiz at the end of each chapter to test knowledge.

## Student & Admin Dashboards:

**Student View:** Tracks score, level, and achievements unlocked.

**Admin View:** Provides an overview of all student progress.

## Advanced UI/UX:

**Animated Hero Page:** A stunning, animated entry point for a professional first impression.

**Interactive Particle Background:** A theme-aware, animated background that makes the dashboard feel alive and modern.

**Light/Dark Mode:** Full support for both light and dark themes.

**Multi-Language Support:** Integrated with the Google Translate widget for maximum accessibility.

## üíª Technology Stack
**Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules), HTML5, CSS3 with Tailwind CSS for styling.

**Backend & Authentication:** Firebase (Authentication).

**PWA & Offline Storage:** Service Worker, Cache API, and LocalStorage for a local-first data approach.

**Deployment:** Vercel.

## üöÄ Getting Started
**Clone the repository:** git clone https://github.com/your-username/DisasterReady-PWA.git

**Navigate to the project directory:** cd DisasterReady-PWA

**Serve the files using a simple local server**. For example, if you have Python installed: **python -m http.server**

## üîÆ Future Scope
**Real-Time Admin Alerts:** Implement a system for admins to send live push notifications to all student PWAs.

**Interactive School Map:** Create a gamified drill where students interact with a map of a school to find evacuation routes and safety equipment.

**"School Preparedness Score":** Develop an algorithm for the admin dashboard that calculates a single, actionable safety score for the entire institution.
